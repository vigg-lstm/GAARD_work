\subsection{Choice of kinship treshold}

We calculated pairwise kinship between all samples using the KING statistic \parencite{Man10} implemented in NGSRelate \parencite{Kor15} using SNP data across the whole genome. Whole genome SNPs were used because the recombination rate on such a small genome can lead to large disparity in kinship values between chromosomes (Fig. \ref{FigM1}). Results indicated a slight positive bias in kinship, with the mode of the distribution slightly above 0 (Fig. \ref{FigM2}). Because of this positive bias in kinship values, we sought to empirically establish the most parsimonious threshold to identify full siblings in our data, instead of the threshold of 0.177 suggested in the manual (\url{https://www.kingrelatedness.com/manual.shtml}). For all possible threshhold between 0.15 and 0.35, in increments of 0.005, we identified all full siblings and counted the proportion of full sib groups that contained inconsistencies (where siblings of siblings were not themselves classed as siblings). The script to carry out this analysis is available at . We chose the threshold 0.195 as that which produced the smallest proportion of inconsistent sib groups.

	\caption{\footnotesize Genetic difference (calculated as the mean proportion of nucleotide differences across all sites) between a single pair of siblings (WA-0997 and WA-1288, both \textit{An. coluzzii} from Korle-Bu in Ghana) across the genome. Aside from the centromeres, the values of genetic difference occupy one of three states: 0 (genetically identical, where the two individuals inherited the same allele from both their mother and their father, for example the start of Chromosome 2L), around 0.007 (intermediate: where the two individuals inherited the same allele from one of their parents, but not the other, for example the middle of chromosome 2L) and around 0.014 (low: where the two individuals inherited different alleles from both their mother and their father, for example the end of chromosome 2L). These states are invariant over large stretches of the genome (eg: the whole of chromosome 3L is identical between these two individuals) due to the recombination rate per site per generation (usually assumed to be $10{-8}$ for modelling purposes) relative to the size of a chromosome (on the order of $5 x 10^{-7}$). Thus, a single chromosome can give an inaccurate picture of relatedness (using chromosome 3L for this pair would make them appear to be clones).}

Middle and right: stacked and coloured by whether the pair is of individuals from the same (light colours) or different (dark colours) sampling locations. \textbf{b} Stacked and coloured by whether the pair is of individuals with the same (light) or different (dark) 2La karyotype. The three modes of the distribution correspond to the 2La karyotype of the pair, with the right hand mode consisting of pairs of 2La heterozygotes (shared heterozygote genotype produces the largest relatedness values), the main central mode consisting of pairs with the same homozygous karyotype (in dark) or where one individual is heterozygous and the other homozygous (in light), and the left hand mode consisting of pairs with opposite homozygous karyotypes.}

\subsection{\fst\ outlier analysis}

We calculcated \fst\ between phenotype classes (dead / alive after exposure to insecticides) in windows of 1000 SNPs across the genome, and wanted to identify peaks in the data. We used the fact that true \fst\ peaks in these data should only be positive, and that the mode of the distribution corresponding to areas with no differentiation is roughly symmetrical. We therefore used the left hand part of the \fst\ distribution to determine what the right hand part would typically look like in the absence of peaks \ref{FigM3}.
