Darkness of blue (\textit  {An. gambiae}) and red (\textit  {An. coluzzii}) provided as a visual aid for the magnitude of the value in each cell. The genomic coordinates of each CNV allele can be found in Supplementary Data @@. In each cluster, the ``Dup0'' column indicates the presence of increased copy number in any of the genes in the cluster. Where this is larger than the sum of known alleles, it suggests the presence of CNV alleles not present in the Ag1000G database. ``Del'' alleles in Ace1 represent secondary deletions within the Ace1-Dup1 CNV.\relax }}{2}\protected@file@percent }
