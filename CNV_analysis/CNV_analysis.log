Cyp6aap alleles in Avrankou:
Using the following string to control for confounding factors: 

Detecting invariable and nearly invariable markers.

Analysing markers independently.

Running commentary on model optimisation:

Building model: glm(phenotype ~ 1 , data = avrankou.delta.allele.table, family = binomial) 
	No further markers are significant, keeping final model:

Call:  glm(formula = phenotype ~ 1, family = binomial, data = avrankou.delta.allele.table)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)  
    -0.2803  

Degrees of Freedom: 78 Total (i.e. Null);  78 Residual
  (11 observations deleted due to missingness)
Null Deviance:	    108 
Residual Deviance: 108 	AIC: 110
Final model was the null model.
